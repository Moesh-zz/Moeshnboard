# Moeshnboard

Moesh's map making template for Minecraft: Java Edit v1.12. This board includes chunk marking, and lack of rain for 32,737 ticks. Spawnpoint is set to x:136 z:136 to allow for a 13x13 chunk spawn area. This has the added effect of the map being contained within only one region file (r.0.0.mca). This makes versioning the "level assets" very clear and easy.
